# Taskhub waitlist landing review

## Quick take
The page explains the value for service providers, but messaging, consistency, and proof should be tightened to improve credibility and conversions.

## Copy and messaging
- Headline clarity: change “Get Paid For Your Skills the Task Hub Waitlist” to “Get paid for your skills. Join the Taskhub waitlist.” or “Join Taskhub — get matched with clients and get paid.”
- Name consistency: pick one brand form everywhere (use “Taskhub”).
- Value prop focus: highlight hierarchy in hero — match quality, no fees, fast sign-up.
- Benefit bullets: keep parallel structure and add specifics, e.g., “Pre-screened clients to reduce no-shows and spam.”
- Social proof: replace “Thousands…” with precise proof or remove until true; add logos/testimonials/metrics when available.

## Design and UX
- CTA prominence: one primary CTA label site-wide (“Join the waitlist”) with consistent color and placement in hero and mid-page.
- Visual hierarchy: hero as 1–2 line headline, subhead below, then CTA; reduce competing elements near the fold.
- Steps section: convert the 1–4 steps into a horizontal/grid layout with concise labels and icons for quick scan.
- Avatar strip: ensure avatars are authentic or clearly illustrative; consider short testimonials instead.

## Trust and credibility
- No-fees claim: add a short explainer link (“How Taskhub makes money”) to preempt skepticism.
- Policies: add visible footer links to Privacy, Terms, and Contact; add a brief privacy assurance near the form.
- Brand voice: keep friendly, professional tone; avoid over-promising.

## Form and conversion
- Friction: reduce initial form to email + role (service type); defer detailed profile fields.
- Confirmation state: keep friendly modal copy; add a clear next action and a share option.
- Double opt-in: consider optional email verification to keep list quality high.

## Content accuracy and consistency
- Grammar and punctuation: fix hero grammar; use proper spacing around numbers/units; standardize heading capitalization.
- Resolve “200+ service providers” vs “Thousands…” conflict; pick one truthful stat and keep it current.
- Use sentence case or title case consistently across headings.

## Accessibility and performance
- Contrast: ensure CTA and text meet WCAG AA contrast.
- Alt text: provide descriptive alt text for images (not just filenames like “Avatar 01”).
- Mobile: check spacing and tap targets on small screens; keep CTAs above the fold on mobile.
- Performance: optimize images and defer non-critical scripts; aim for <2s LCP on 4G.

## SEO basics
- Title tag: include brand and value prop, e.g., “Taskhub Waitlist — Get matched with verified clients.”
- Meta description: 150–160 chars summarizing value and free sign-up.
- H1: single clear H1; use H2s for sections like Why, How it works, Social proof.

## Metrics to track post-changes
- Hero CTA click-through rate
- Waitlist form start and completion rate
- Share rate on confirmation
- Mobile vs desktop conversion split
